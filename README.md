# tableau-challenge

## PLEASE READ
I've created this GitHub repository to store my data files and Jupyter Notebooks I used for ETL as well as provide the link to my Tableau Workbook.  
Here's the link: https://public.tableau.com/views/m-groh-tableau-challenge/Citibike2023Story?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

NOTE: If for any reason you need the CSVs I used, one of them was too large to push to this repository. To get them, run everything in etl.ipynb first and then everything in etl-2.ipynb after. That should get you the CSVs.
